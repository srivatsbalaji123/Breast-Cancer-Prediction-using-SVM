# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-SVM
Welcome to my kernel!

In this particular project I aim to predict breast cancer using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and try to attain the maximum accuracy possible using scaling and grid searching techniques.

The dataset used in this project was the breast cancer dataset in which there are 569 instances and 30 variables. 
There are 30 predictor variables which contain all the features of the tumor images.
The response variable is called 'target' which contains 0 and 1 where 0-Malignant and 1-Benign

In after applying all the scaling and grid searching techniques along with the SVM algorithm, it was possible to attain  an accuracy score of 97%
